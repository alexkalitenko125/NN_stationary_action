# NN_stationary_action
NN for the classical mechanics


The stationary-action principle – also known as the principle of least action – is a variational principle that, when applied to the action of a mechanical system, yields the equations of motion for that system. The principle states that the trajectories (i.e. the solutions of the equations of motion) are stationary points of the system's action functional.

$\mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N$
<math display="block"> \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt </math>
where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and {{mvar|t}} is time.
